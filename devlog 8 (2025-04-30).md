## Overview

Hi! Oz here with a couple of updates for our game **Lonnies Fishtank**!

The past few weeks we worked on:
- **Game Feel**: Using Feel and Text Animator, the appearance of the UI in the game has been dramatically improved to look more fun and responsive. This is accompanied by the awesome updates that Adrian worked on to the UI assets.
- **Environment Updates**: Ashley also worked very hard to create new assets to spruce up the room in the game! A new bed model, desk, dresser and skateboard are now featured!

Check out all of these updates in the devlog video below!
