# Overview

Hey! Oz here with some more updates on **Lonnies Fishtank!**

The past few weeks we worked on:
- **New Cel Shader**: I added a simple cel shader to the game from the FlatKit Unity asset. This shader enabled us to get a more toon like feeling in the game and makes the fish look great!
- **Walk Scene Models**: Ashley created some great looking models for the walking scene that really have helped to pull it together! The houses, mailboxes, gas lamps, and leash are looking awesome!
- **Trailer Jam**: We are actively working on putting together a rough trailer for our game. We're hoping to use this opportunity to better nail down the aesthetic of the game and start getting the word out about what we're working on!

Check out these updates in the devlog video below!
